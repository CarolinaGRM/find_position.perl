# find_position.perl
This script searches a file for a list of chromosomal positions. First, the script asks for the location of the vcf format file (containing the identified variants) to be analyzed and, if the file is found, it asks for a text file containing the list of positions to be located in the vcf format file. The script returns, in a file named “result.txt”, all the variants and the zygosity information.
